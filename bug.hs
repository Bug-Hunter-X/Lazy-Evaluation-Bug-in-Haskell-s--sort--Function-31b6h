```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let ys = sort xs
  print ys
```
This code seems innocuous, but it has a subtle bug related to laziness. If the list `xs` were extremely large, the `sort` function might not fully evaluate before `print` is executed. This leads to unexpected behavior because `sort` only evaluates as needed by `print`, resulting in a partial or incorrect sorting.
